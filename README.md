# COP4813_Projects
All 5 of the Internet Programming projects from COP 4813, inlcuding HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP files.

This was from the COP4813 course offered at the University of North Florida, summer of 2018, taught by Jim Littleton.
These are mostly just simple demonstrations that express familiarity with the languages listed above.

Some of the code, especially in the projects that included Javascript and PHP, we were given a template, which was presumably written by professor Littleton. Projects 4 and 5 had select few lines of code we were also provided.
However, the vast majority of the content within these files is my own work.

Project 4, we were given third party API key to use, and all processes involving email IDs were specific to the course. Therefore, the project will not run on an ordinary server. Again, this is largely just to demonstrate the knowledge of some basic internet programming.
