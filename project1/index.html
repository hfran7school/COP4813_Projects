		<p>Hello, I am Hailey Francis. My favorite color is purple, my favorite ice ice cream flavor is <br>
		chocolate chip cookie dough, and my favorite animals are hedgehogs, cats, and ducks. </p>

		<p>My family has raised a lot of different types of animals over the years, including peacocks, <br>
		horses, and even a 
		<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_tortoise target="_blank" class="big">Russian Tortoise</a>
		and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guineafowl target="_blank" class="big"> Guinea Fowl</a>. My most precious
		pet at the moment is my fat orange cat a family friend found on the highway as a kitten.</p>

		<p> I really love playing games, whether its video games, board games, card games, mind games,<br>
		you name it and I'm usually down to play. The only games I'm not super interested in are anything<br>
		involving guns.</p>

		<p> I also really love baking, fishing, kayaking, and finding shark teeth at the beach. I have a small <br>
		container that has all of the shark teeth I've collected over the years. (My mom also bought me a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon target="_blank" class="big">Megalodon</a><br>
		tooth that I can't take credit for.)</p>
